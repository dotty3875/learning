"""In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a liquid. ðŸ§ª

Create a ph_levels.py program that checks whether a pH level is basic, acidic, or neutral.

First, create a ph variable and ask the user for a value between 0 and 14.

Write an if, elif, else statement that:

If ph is greater than 7, output "Basic".
If ph is less than 7, output "Acidic".
Else, output "Neutral"."""

pH = float(input("What is your pH? "))

if pH > 7: #if you wanted it to be equal or greater than 7 you would put a =>
  print("Basic!")
elif pH < 7:
  print("Acidic!")
else: 
  print("Neutral!")
