"""Please write a program which asks the user to type in an integer number. If the user types in a number equal to or below 0, the execution ends. 
Otherwise the program prints out the factorial of the number.

The factorial of a number involves multiplying the number by all the positive integers smaller than itself. In other words, it is the product of 
all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120."""


#my solution after an hour!

# wasted my time thinking it was meant to be, say input is 5, 5 x 1 + 5 x 2 so on so forth which was 75 but its really 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120
# didnt know what a factorial really was!

# now that i look at it i can easily remove 2-3 lines that are redundant
